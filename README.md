# Deployment:

### Code:

Create a production build with

```
npm run build
```

This gets saved in `dist/`, and the files will be in `dist/static`. Create a `.zip` file in here (`dist/static.zip`). We'll need it for uploading to namecheap.

### Namecheap

- Go to the dashboard, and get to `Cpanel` by clicking the storage icon (the icon in the middle of the products section)

- go to `File Manager`

- Go to the `public_html` folder. Use the action bar on the top to select all and delete everything in here.

- Uploading folders is not possible, so the easiest way is to upload the contents are:
  - upload the `.zip` file mentioned earlier
  - extract it.
  - go to the extracted folder, and using the action bar on top, move all files to the root of `public_html`.
  - delete the zip file and the empty folder
- Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
